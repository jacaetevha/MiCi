What is MiCi?
=============

The Name
--------
MiCi stands for Move-it-Click-it! Yeah, I'm not very creative when it comes to naming things. I pronounce is mee-see, but if you're of the Italian (and some Latin) varieties perhaps you'd like to say mee-chee.

The Purpose
-----------
MiCi's sole purpose is to create some interaction with your desktop so that your OS doesn't put it to sleep.

Usage
=====

MiCi depends on Java 1.4+, which most OSes will come with today. You can get a list of available options by running:

    java -jar mici.jar -h

You can build the JAR file yourself (see below) or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/downloads/jacaetevha/MiCi/mici.jar "Pre-built JAR file")

Building
========

Building MiCi's JAR file is simple, just run the `create_jar` script. It doesn't clean up after itself, so you'll have a `MiCi.class` file in your directory after running the script.


Contributing
============
Fork the project and send me a pull request. I don't expect to be doing anything fancy with this.
