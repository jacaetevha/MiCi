What is MiCi?
=============

The Name
--------
MiCi stands for Move-it-Click-it! Yeah, I'm not very creative when it comes to naming things. I pronounce is mee-see, but if you're of the Italian (and some Latin) varieties perhaps you'd like to say mee-chee.

The Purpose
-----------
MiCi's sole purpose is to create some interaction with your desktop so that your OS doesn't put it to sleep.

Usage
=====

MiCi depends on Java 1.4+, which most OSes will come with today. You can get a list of available options by running:

    run_mici -h

or, on Windows:

    run_mici.bat -h

Building
========

Building MiCi is simple, just run the `create_versioned_app` script (*nix only, unless someone else will submit a Windows batch file for this).


Contributing
============
Fork the project and send me a pull request. I don't expect to be doing anything fancy with this.
